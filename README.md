# date-icon-fixer

Date Icon Fixer plugin for WordPress

Removes all default calendar icons from HTML `<input type="date">` fields â€” especially that stubborn one in Firefox ðŸ˜‰.

This plugin replaces native browser date pickers with the lightweight and fully customizable Flatpickr calendar, giving you full control over the look and behavior of your date inputs.

Perfect if you're tired of inconsistent styling or want to deliver a more unified user experience across browsers.

âœ… Replaces `<input type="date">` with Flatpickr  
âœ… Fully local, no CDN required  
âœ… Firefox-friendly â€” no more native icon  
âœ… Enable or disable the feature from your WordPress dashboard
âœ… Works with Contact Form 7
