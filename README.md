# Date Icon Fixer

**Date Icon Fixer** is a WordPress plugin that removes default calendar icons from HTML `<input type="date">` fields â€” especially that stubborn one in Firefox ðŸ˜‰.  
It replaces the native browser date pickers with [Flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/), a lightweight and highly customizable JavaScript calendar.

Perfect if you're tired of inconsistent styling and want to deliver a more unified user experience across all browsers.
